This upload fixes MIXXX skin display of channels and waveforms. 

You can either download the whole folder and place it inside you MIXXX folder under skins. Then choose it inside MIXXX.

You can also fix this yourself by changing the numbers of the mixer channels and waveforms. The order before the change is 3,1,2,4. 
Change this to fx 1, 2, 3, 4 or however you would like the order to be. 


Youtube video coming soon! 

Hope you enjoy!
